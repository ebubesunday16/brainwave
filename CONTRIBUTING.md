# Contributing

Hey! If youâ€™re here, thanks for considering contributing!

This is a casual side project, so nothing too strict. But here are a few things:

- Keep the design consistent (clean, minimal, no clutter)
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS
- Keep components reusable where it makes sense

PRs are welcome. Just make sure to write clean code and maybe drop a short note on what you added or changed.

Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
