# 🧩 Sleek React UI – Built Just Because It Looked Cool

So I stumbled on this design while doom scrolling, and honestly... I couldn’t resist. It looked too good not to build. So here we are.

This is a simple React project with a clean, sleek, and modern design. Nothing over-engineered. Just something that looks good, feels good, and runs smooth.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ React (of course)
- 🎨 Sleek and minimal design
- 💅 Tailwind CSS for styling
- ⚡ Fast load, responsive, and snappy
- 📱 Mobile-first design approach

## 🛠 Stack

- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide
- **Animations**: React Parallax (because, why not)
